# sieve3d

## Summary

Generation script to generate variable size sieves (for 3D pringing) to help with Lego sorting. Details at: https://www.brickodyssey.com/3d-printing-lego-sieves/

## Usage

This is using SolidPython from https://github.com/SolidCode/SolidPython, so you need to install that first.

Edit the script to change the `hole_diam` and the `sep` param to a suitable value (several sieve of different size are probably needed). Then, run as

```
python generate.py
```
